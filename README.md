#🌳 Task 03 – Decision Tree Classification on Bank Marketing Dataset


The focus of this task was to apply a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit based on the Bank Marketing Dataset.

🎯 Project Objective

 Use a **Decision Tree** to classify customers based on banking features
 Understand the influence of various features (like job, marital status, balance, duration) on the customer’s response
 Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

 🔍 Process Overview

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   - Identified and handled missing or irrelevant features
   - Used label encoding for categorical variables

2. **Model Building**
   - Built a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets

3. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
   - Interpreted the results with visualizations (feature importance and decision tree plot)

 ✅ Outcome

- **Model Accuracy Achieved:** ~79%
- Demonstrated the Decision Tree’s ability to classify based on interpretable splits
- Observed class imbalance in the dataset and its impact on performance

 📊 Key Insights

- The `duration` of last contact and `poutcome` (previous marketing outcome) were strong predictors
- The model performed well on training data but needed pruning/tuning for generalization
- Decision Trees are easy to interpret but can overfit on complex datasets

🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Gained practical experience in supervised classification
- Understood how Decision Trees create splits based on feature entropy/gini
- Learned the importance of evaluating both accuracy and class-wise metrics
